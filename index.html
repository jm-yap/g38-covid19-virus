							<p>In the age of information, disinformation poses a significant challenge. Social media platforms have become breeding grounds for misleading news, causing numerous users to fall victim to false narratives.
								 The COVID-19 pandemic, which confined people to their homes and increased their reliance on phones, has made Filipinos more susceptible to fake news and even led to skepticism about the virus itself. This study, titled <b>"Scamdemic lang yan! A Content Analysis on Filipino Tweets Spreading False Claims About the COVID-19 Virus,"</b> aims to investigate specific false claims regarding the existence of COVID-19.</p>

					<h3>Categorical Data Encoding</h3>
					<ol>
						<li><b>Get the most common categories</b></li>
						<p>In Google Sheets, pivot table was applied to the dataframe to summarize and analyze data quickly and efficiently. In the pivot table editor, the column “False Claim” was dragged into the "Rows" section of the pivot table editor which groups the data by category. The same category column was dragged into the "Values" section which counts the occurrences of each category. Then sort the resulting table in descending order to get the most common categories in the top rows. (Refer to the “False Claim” sheet to see the most common categories)
						</p>
						<li><b>Count content types per category</b></li>
						<p>In the pivot table editor, the column “False Claim” and “Content Type” were dragged into the "Rows" section of the pivot table editor which groups the data by category. The same category column “Content Type” was dragged into the "Values" section which counts the occurrences of each category. (Refer to the “Content Type” sheet for the count of content types per category)</p>
						<li><b>Get most common tweet type per category</b></li>
						<p>In the pivot table editor, the column “False Claim” and “Tweet Type” were dragged into the "Rows" section of the pivot table editor which groups the data by category. The same category column “Tweet Type” was dragged into the "Values" section which counts the occurrences of each category. (Refer to the “Tweet Type” sheet for the most common tweet types per category)</p>
						<li><b>Get the highest count of likes, replies, and retweets per category</b></li>
						<p>Apply a filter to the table containing the columns “Like”, “Replies”, “Retweets”, and “False Claims”. Sort the table in descending order and filter the category you want to view to get the highest count of likes, replies, and retweets per category in the top row. (Refer to the “Likes, Replies, and Retweets” sheet to see the highest count of likes, replies, and retweets per category)</p>
						<li><b>Get most influential account type per category</b></li>
						<p>Apply a filter to the table containing the columns “Account Type”, “Followers”, and “False Claims”. Sort the table in descending order and filter the category you want to view to see the most influential account type per category in the top row. (Refer to the “Account Type” sheet to see the most influential account type per category)</p>
					</ol>

					<h3>Chi Square Test</h3>
					<!-- BODY -->
					<p>As we are dealing with the frequency of categorical data, the group implemented the <b>Chi Square test</b> in checking the distribution of
						each category. From the null hypothesis, we expect that tweets that do not beleive in the COVID-19 virus use various false claims in equal proportion.
						Therefore, the expected value for each is 150/6 = 25.
					</p>
					
					<!-- UNDERLINE -->
					<h3>Chi Squared Values</h3>
					<!-- BODY -->
					<p>The observed and expected frequencies were encoded in the given table below. Using the observed frequencies of each category, we computed the mean and
						standard deviation using Google Sheet's built-in tools. From there, we manually calculated the Chi Squared values of each category to obtain the sum.
					</p>
					<!-- UNDERLINE -->
					<h3>Test for Significance</h3>
					<!-- BODY -->
					<p>
						To test for significance in the data distribution, we performed a goodness-of-fit test in the critical region at a 0.05 significance level and 5 degrees of freedom.
						With the help of Google Sheet's built-in Right Tail Chi Square Distribution function, we found that the p-value for our dataset is 7.46E-05, which is considerably
						less than the significance level. Hence, we reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis that states that the categorical data are not in equal proportion.
					</p>
					<h3>Standardizing Residuals</h3>
					<!-- BODY -->
					<p>
						The standarized residuals per category were computed through the difference of the observed and expected value, divided by the square root of the expected value.
						This operation was performed on the sheet. Upon checking the standardized scores, it was found that the false claim of COVID-19 being a financial scheme of private sectors
						is a major contributor to the disbelief in the virus according to the tweets as it obtained a score greater than +2. On the other hand, the false claim on it being a fear 
						tactic was determined as a weak contributor with a standardized score of less than -2.

					<h3>Latent Dirichlet Allocation</h3>
					<p>
						Topic clustering through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was used to categorize tweets in the dataset. Associated keywords were collected to form a list of categories to automatically label each tweet through NLP.

LDA is a generative probabilistic model under unsupervised machine learning. It assumes that each tweet is composed by each topic and computes the probability of a word belonging to them. As the tweets were tokenized into keywords through preprocessing (see Data Exploration), the authors should initialize the specific parameters of the model. These variables include the number of topics to be generated and the number of keywords to represent each topic. With that, LDA can now analyze their distribution of words through the following steps:

<br><br>For each word in each tweet,
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>randomly assign them to a topic</li>
						<li>compute its probability to belong in each topic based on the current document</li>
						<li>compute its probability to belong in each topic based on the whole sample</li>
						<li>update the probability of each word belonging to each topic</li>
						<li>resample the topic assignment for each word based on its probability</li>
						<li>repeat the from step 2 until the model converges or reaches a specified number of iterations</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						In order to come up with coherent key words for each topic, stop words that were not in the package in the preprocessing were excluded or included. While removing stop words is used to reduce noise and improve efficiency, there are situations where their inclusion can provide advantages in terms of information retrieval. 
						<br><br>
Starting with a small number of topics, LDA was executed multiple times. Manual inspection was done until meaningful and distinct topics were obtained. 
<br><br>
Through LDA, 4 topics were generated namely,

					</p>
					<ol>
						<li><b>Financial Scheme</b> - entails perpetuating the pandemic to profit from it financially
						<br><i>Keywords:</i> money, stupid, fake, devil, believe, real, corrupt, business, increase, let</li>
						<li><b>Government Fabrication</b> - suggests that the virus itself does not exist and is just a deliberate fabrication orchestrated by the government
						<br><i>Keywords:</i> economy, dutertepalpak, research, government, fake, scam, country, money, making, pneumonia</li>
						<li><b>Conspiracy Theory</b> - suggests hidden agendas and secret plots, such as the pandemic is tool for control or manipulation, by influential people or groups
						<br><i>Keywords:</i> omicron, china, image, vaccinated, chinese, deadly, communist, going, research, brain</li>
						<li><b>Others</b> - any claims about the COVID-19 virus that doesn't belong to the categories mentioned above (e.g. misclassified illness, lack of personal experience)
						<br><i>Keywords:</i> medicine, world, variant, name, hoax, disease, isolated, whole, kill, time</li>
					</ol>

					<div class="image-mask">
						<img src="newplot-4.png" alt="plot">
					</div>
					<br>

					<h3>Evaluation</h3>

					<p>
						The data modeling technique used yielded reasonably accurate results in labeling the tweets with their respective clusters. As shown through the generated topics, most of the top keywords were related to them and to one another. Hence, upon checking, there are a number of tweets which were properly labeled by assessing their keywords and sentiment. The following are examples of tweets for each topic
					</p>

					<p><b>Financial Scheme:</b> “sayang lang ang pera sa testing oh my gulay phil heath wala na ang covid gawa gawa lang ng big pharma at gahaman sa pera para sa plandemic”</p>
					<p><b>Government Fabrication:</b> “wala naman talagang covid brad. ginagago lang tayo ng gvrnmnt”</p>
					<p><b>Conspiracy Theory:</b> "covid19 is a false flag operation! a hoax and a plandemic not to billgatesvaccine!!!!"</p>
					<p><b>Others:</b> “mga sir...kaming mga bisaya at mindanao hindi kc kami naniwala sa covid simpling trangkaso lang kc yan at wag tayong sunudsuran sa doh 😡😡😡"</p>

					<p>While LDA did show accurate results to some extent, there are some tweets which were inappropriately labeled. These occurrences are possibly due to unremoved stopwords, typographical errors, and the model’s own limitations. Some of the tweets which were miscategorized are as follows:</p>

					<p><b>Mislabeled as Others (should be Government Fabrication):</b> “naglolokohan nalang tayo dito ssob eh hahaha di naman totoo yang covid. gawa gawa lang ng gov yan para takutin tayo.”					</p>
					<p><b>Mislabeled as Financial Scheme (should be Conspiracy Theory):</b> “hindi naman kasi talaga totoo ang covid illuminati lang kayo 😂”</p>
					
					<p>Overall, LDA was shown to be a reliable data modeling tool for topic clustering in our dataset. However, may also be prone to misclassification, which can be further minimized through more advanced preprocessing. It is recommended to add additional steps in preprocessing and explore other parameters to improve the model’s accuracy.

					<h3>Introduction</h3>
					<p>
						Since 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected the economy, livelihood, and overall well-being of several countries. Various measures have been taken to minimize its impact, such as proper health protocols, mass testing, and vaccination.  However, with the rise of false information regarding the virus, citizens may be prone to vaccine hesitancy and disbelief in COVID-19. To spread awareness regarding misinformation regarding the COVID-19 virus being shared on social media (i.e. Twitter), this study analyzes the common false claims associated with Filipinos’ disbelief in the virus
					</p>

					<h3>Materials and Methods</h3>
					<ol>
						<li><b>Data Collection</b> <br>
							150 tweets (within the years 2020-2022) from Filipino users claiming that COVID-19 is not real were scraped from Twitter using associated keywords and the following techniques:
							<ul>
								<li>Twitter Scrapers (Apify, snscrape)</li>
								<li>Manual Searching (Twitter advanced search)</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><b>Preprocessing</b> <br>
							The authors applied Natural Language Processing through Python packages to convert the collected data into tokens
							<ul>
								<li>Handling missing values</li>
								<li>Formatting consistency</li>
								<li>Lowercasing and translation, tokenization</li>
								<li>Stop words removal</li>
								<li>Stemming and lemmatization</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><b>Data Modeling</b> <br>
							Topic clustering through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was used to categorize tweets in the dataset. Associated keywords were collected to form a list of categories to automatically label each tweet through NLP.
						</li>
						<br>
						<li><b>Statistical Test</b> <br>
							The Chi-square goodness of fit test at a 0.05 significance level was utilized to assess if the frequency distribution of each category among the dataset is equal.
						</li>
					</ol>

					<h3>Results and Discussion</h3>

					<p>
						The research findings suggest an unequal distribution of the frequency of false claims that contributes to Filipinos’ skepticism about the existence of the COVID-19 virus. Despite the persistence of numerous false claims on this topic, the research identified distinct categories of false claims with varying frequencies.
						<br><br>
						However, the research is limited in that it does not establish a direct link between the frequency of false claims and their influence. Further investigations are required to explore this aspect. Moreover, the development of a model capable of identifying the specific false claim/s responsible for such an unequal association to the disbelief would be highly beneficial.
						<br><br>
						This study and its ongoing continuation hold significant value due to their potential to mitigate or even eradicate the adverse effects of disinformation across various domains, extending beyond the context of COVID-19. Our findings add to people's existing knowledge about misinformation and its role in public perception. Therefore, by identifying and debunking the false claim most strongly associated with the topic, we can effectively reduce the larger number of people who believe in the piece of disinformation.
					</p>
					
					<h3>Implications</h3>

					<p>
						The study offers a promising strategy to mitigate the impact of disinformation, as highlighted in the results. By identifying and debunking the most influential false claim contributing to misguided beliefs, we can effectively reduce the number of individuals affected by it.
						<br><br>
						Moreover, the model developed in this study holds practical value beyond its current application. It can be utilized in other research endeavors aiming to categorize large datasets into specific categories. Additionally, the model provides statistical tests that enable comprehensive analysis of these categories, leading to conclusive results.
					</p>

					<h3>Conclusion</h3>

					<p>
						Based on the study's findings, the false claims do not have an equal distribution in the sample data collected. Hence, there may be underlying factors that influence the prevalence of COVID-19 disbelief with regards to the aforementioned false claims.  The results would be beneficial in extending the research involving the correlation between COVID-19 denial and particular false claims. The results of further research can contribute in planning initiatives for educating the public about more prevalent false claims that are associated with COVID-19 disbelief.
